# hello-world

Technically-Ky here, I like XML and reusing content to create consistency in documentation. 
I have had experience converting Word files to XML and creating websites for hosting documentation and training assets for large enterprises in the computer software industry. I enjoy long walks with my dog, Dex, researching the latest trends in Technical Writing, and writing documentation and maintaining document repositories. I am facinated by the rate at which technology is changing, and I love to create new ways to help people leverage technology to make the products I support simple, accessible, and intuitive so readers can get back to doing whatever it is they enjoy doing.
